# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of our open-source community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- **Be respectful:** Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. Treat others with dignity and respect. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.
- **Be considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be collaborative:** Work together! We can accomplish more together than we can alone. Collaboration is at the heart of our community.
- **Be open-minded:** Be open to learning new things and to different perspectives. Challenge yourself to grow and expand your knowledge.
- **Be inclusive:** Seek out and encourage participation from all community members. Make it a point to listen to and amplify voices that might otherwise be marginalized or ignored.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- **Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.**
- **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.**
- **Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.**
- **Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").**
- **Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.**
- **Inappropriate photography or recording.**
- **Unwelcome sexual attention.**
- **Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.**

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by contacting [INSERT CONTACT INFO]. All reports will be handled with discretion.
